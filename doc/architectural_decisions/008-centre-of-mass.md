# 8. Using our own Centre of Mass Callback

## Status

Current

## Context

A decision needs to be made about whether to make changes to upstream Bluesky so that their {external+bluesky:py:obj}`bluesky.callbacks.fitting.PeakStats` callback works for us, or we make our own.

## Decision

We will be making our own {py:obj}`CentreOfMass <ibex_bluesky_core.callbacks.CentreOfMass>` callback.

## Justification & Consequences

[We attempted to make changes to upstream Bluesky which were rejected](https://github.com/bluesky/bluesky/pull/1878), as it adds limits to the functionality of the callback. We also found other limitations with using their callback, such as not being able to have disordered and non-continuous data sent to it without it skewing the calculated value - we need it to work with disordered and non-continuous data as we need to be able to run continuous scans.

We currently only need to support positive peaks, but in future a toggle could be added to {py:obj}`CentreOfMass <ibex_bluesky_core.callbacks.CentreOfMass>` to allow for negative peaks. 

This will mean that...
- Our version of the callback will not be supported by Bluesky and may need changes as Bluesky updates.
- We can have a version of the callback that is made bespokely for our use cases.
