# 7. Output file archiving

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our bluesky implementation contains bluesky callbacks which produce scientist-facing output files, for example:
- [Human-readable scan result files](/callbacks/file_writing): {py:obj}`HumanReadableFileCallback <ibex_bluesky_core.callbacks.HumanReadableFileCallback>`
- [Fitting results](/callbacks/fitting/livefit_logger): {py:obj}`LiveFitLogger <ibex_bluesky_core.callbacks.LiveFitLogger>`
- [Plot PNGs](#plot_png_saver): {py:obj}`PlotPNGSaver <ibex_bluesky_core.callbacks.PlotPNGSaver>`

In addition, we have a {ref}`developer-facing callback for diagnostics <event_doc_cb>`, 
{py:obj}`DocLoggingCallback <ibex_bluesky_core.callbacks.DocLoggingCallback>`.

The above callbacks produce files on disk in response to a bluesky scan. These files contain valuable data and so we
need to consider how these files are archived for the long term. This must align with the 
[ISIS Data Policy](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/pages/data-policy.aspx). We should make an attempt to align with
[FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).

According to the definitions in the [ISIS Data Policy](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/pages/data-policy.aspx), the data
generated by bluesky is generally either "facility generated reduced data" or "metadata".

This ADR is concerned with the location in which these bluesky output files are stored, and the archiving infrastructure
which is therefore used to keep these files for the long term.

---

At the time of writing this ADR, in June 2025, the scientist-facing files are being written to
```
...\inst$\<instrument>\user\bluesky_scans\<rb_number>\
```

This location has some disadvantages:
- It is a network location, which means that a site network break will cause bluesky scans to fail to run
- It is not a location designed for long-term scientifically useful data - for example in terms of data integrity
- It is not necessarily accessible from downstream systems such as Topcat

Therefore, we would like to define a different, more suitable, location into which bluesky output files can be written.

## Present

The following people have been involved in discussions leading up to this ADR:

- Tom
- Chris M-S
- George
- Kathryn
- Jack H
- CK (Reflectometry)

This document was additionally reviewed:
- In a regular Thursday code-review slot by the whole IBEX team.
- In a regular scans library catch-up meeting, including RD (SANS), CK (Reflectometry), JL (Muons)

## Decisions

### File-writing location

Bluesky should write data into the `c:\data\RB<rb_number>\bluesky_scans\` folder during a scan.
File naming itself will keep its current scheme (timestamped files).

This location was chosen because it mirrors the archiving setup used by neutron cameras on IMAT.

### Attributes & checksums

Bluesky should mark files as read-only, using Windows file attributes, when it has finished writing them. This is so
that the archiving process can unambiguously tell whether a file has finished being written. It also reduces the
likelihood that a file is accidentally modified.

Checksums should be generated, either at the point when the data is initially generated, or by the archiving process
just before it first copies or moves a file.

We have agreed on the desire to generate checksums for data, which is already done for DAE data. These checksums are
useful to check for data corruption, which might occur in transit, or in-place on instrument computers or archive servers.
A number of checksumming approaches have been considered, and no approach has been chosen yet. The options discussed
are:
- **Use windows alternate file streams**. This is how checksums are done in existing DAE `.raw` files. It has the
advantage that it is relatively simple to implement, but the disadvantage that they do not map nicely onto Linux file
systems.
- **Generate one checksum per file**, for example `file.txt` would also have an associated `file.sha1.txt` containing the
checksum. The advantage is that this is simple to implement and platform-agnostic. The disadvantage is that it doubles
the number of files visible in the archive area.
- **Generate a single checksum file** containing the checksums of all bluesky data, at a higher level of granularity (for
example by RB number or by cycle). It is currently unclear exactly how this approach would be implemented, and at what
point these checksums would be moved to the archive.

### Moving to the ISIS archive

An automated cron task will look for read-only Bluesky output files, and their associated checksums, in `c:\data` at
regular short intervals (for example, 1 minute), and will move them to:
- The ISIS data archive, under `autoreduced/bluesky_scans`. The `autoreduced` folder already exists on the archive. 
- The data cache disk on the instrument, under `c:\data\Export only\RB<rb_number\bluesky_scans`.

Data on the cache disk, under `Export only`, is kept on the instrument for a short period (usually 24 hours), and then
deleted by existing processes.

This is run as a cron task so that, if the network happens to be unavailable at the time when a scan ends, the copy
process will catch up when the network becomes available again. This cron task will only move files which sit within
a `bluesky_scans` folder, to prevent it from interfering with other non-bluesky files.

Creating a new `bluesky_scans` folder alongside the existing `autoreduced` folder was considered, but was felt to be
unachievable - it would require too much work relative to using the existing `autoreduced` folder.

### File formats

At present, our scan file output format is explicitly designed to be "human-readable" (and, in fact, the callback which
generates these files is explicitly called
{py:obj}`HumanReadableFileCallback <ibex_bluesky_core.callbacks.HumanReadableFileCallback>`).

We have [issue 26](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_bluesky_core/issues/26) which will implement
machine-readable files, using a format such as `.hdf5` or `.nxs`. These files will sit alongside the existing
human-readable files; it is acknowledged that while machine-readable files are better from a data preservation and
archiving standpoint, we will need to retain the human-readable files to support quick browsing by scientists without
using special software.

## Consequences

- Bluesky output data will be stored in a location suitable for long-term, scientifically useful, data. This includes
data integrity and availability concerns.
- Bluesky scans will no longer be reliant on a network location being available to run a scan
- The initial location where bluesky writes data (`c:\data\<rb number>`) will not be the same as its final location (the
`autoreduced` folder on the ISIS archive). This is also true for current DAE data, as generated by the ISISICP.
