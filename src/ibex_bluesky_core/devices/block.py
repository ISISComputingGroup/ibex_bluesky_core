    use_completion_callback:
        Whether to wait for an EPICS completion callback while setting
        this block. Defaults to true, which is appropriate for most blocks.

    set_success_func:
        An arbitrary function which is called to decide whether the block has
        set successfully yet or not. The function takes (setpoint, actual) as arguments and
        should return true if the value has successfully set and is "ready", or False otherwise.

        This can be used to implement arbitrary tolerance behaviour. For example::

            def check(setpoint: T, actual: T) -> bool:
                return setpoint - 0.1 <= actual <= setpoint + 0.1

        If use_completion_callback is True, the completion callback must complete before
        set_success_func is ever called.

        Executing this function should be "fast" (i.e. the function should not sleep), and it should
        not do any external I/O.

        Defaults to None, which means no check is applied.

    set_timeout_s:
        A timeout, in seconds, on the value being set successfully. The timeout
        applies to the EPICS completion callback (if enabled) and the set success function
        (if provided), and excludes any configured settle time.

        Defaults to None, which means no timeout.

    settle_time_s:
        A wait time, in seconds, which is unconditionally applied just before the set
        status is marked as complete. Defaults to zero.

        The 'BlockMot' object supports motion-specific functionality such as:
        - Stopping if a scan is aborted (supports the bluesky 'Stoppable' protocol)
        - Limit checking (before a move starts - supports the bluesky 'Checkable' protocol)
        - Automatic calculation of move timeouts based on motor velocity
        - Fly scanning

        However, it generally relies on the underlying motor being "well-behaved". For example, a
        motor which does many retries may exceed the simple default timeout based on velocity (it
        is possible to explicitly specify a timeout on set() to override this).

        Blocks pointing at motors do not take a BlockWriteConfiguration parameter, as these
        parameters duplicate functionality which already exists in the motor record. The mapping is:

        use_completion_callback:
            Motors always use completion callbacks to check whether motion has completed. Whether to
            wait on that completion callback can be configured by the 'wait' keyword argument on
            set().
        set_success_func:
            Use .RDBD and .RTRY to control motor retries if the position has not been reached to
            within a specified tolerance. Note that motors which retry a lot may exceed the default
            motion timeout which is calculated based on velocity, distance and acceleration.
        set_timeout_s:
            A suitable timeout is calculated automatically based on velocity, distance and
            acceleration as defined on the motor record. This may be overridden by the 'timeout'
            keyword-argument on set().
